### Terminology
- Tenant - An instance of Azure AD and represents a single organization.
- Azure AD Directory - Each tenant has a dedicated Directory. This is used to perform identity and access management functions for resources. 
- Subscriptions - It is used to pay for services. There can be multiple subscriptions in a Directory.
- Core Domain - The initial domain name <tenant>.onmicrosoft.com is the core domain. it is possible to define custom domain names too.
- Azure resourced are divided into four levels:
  - Management groups
    - Management groups are used to manage multiple subscriptions. 
    - All subscriptions inherit the conditions applied to the management group. 
    - All subscriptions within a single management group belong to the same Azure tenant.
    - A management group can be placed in a lower hierarchy of another management group.
    - There is a single top-level management group - Root management group - for each directory in Azure.
  - Subscriptions
    - An Azure subscription is a logical unit of Azure services that links to an Azure account. 
    - An Azure subscription is a billing and/or access control boundary in an Azure AD Directory. 
    - An Azure AD Directory may have multiple subscriptions but each subscription can only trust a single directory.
    - An Azure role applied at the subscription level applies to all the resources within the subscription.
  - Resource groups
    - A resource group acts as a container for resources. 
    - In Azure, all the resources must be inside a resource group and can belong only to a group. 
    - If a resource group is deleted, all the resources inside it are also deleted. 
    - A resource group has its own Identity and Access Management settings for providing role based access. An Azure role applied to the resource group applied to all the resources in the group.
  - Resources
    - A resource is a deployable item in Azure like VMs, App Services, Storage Accounts etc. 
- Managed identity
  - Azure provides the ability to assign Managed Identities to resources like app service, function apps, virtual machines etc. 
  - Managed Identity uses Azure AD tokens to access other resources (like key vaults, storage accounts) that support Azure AD authentication. 
  - It is a service principal of special type that can be used with Azure resources. 
  - Managed Identity can be system-assigned (tied to a resource and cannot be shared with other resources) or user-assigned (independent life cycle and can be share across resources).
- Azure Resource manager (ARM)
  - It is the client neutral deployment and management service for Azure that is used for lifecycle management (creating, updating and deleting) and access control of of resources.
  - ARM templates can be used for consistent and dependency-defined redeployment of resources.
- Azure RBAC Roles
  - Owner: Full access to all resources and can manage access for other users.
  - Contributor: Full access to all resources, cannot manage access.
  - Reader: View all resources
  - User Access Administrator: View all recources and can manage access for other users.  
- Azure AD roles
  - Global administrator is the most well-known and all powerful administrator role.
  - Global Administrator has the ability to 'elevate' to User Access Administrator Azure role to the root management group.
- Default User Permissions, A normal user has many interesting permissions in Azure AD!
  -   Read all users, Groups, Applications, Devices, Roles, Subscriptions, and their public properties
  -   Invite Guests
  -   Create Security groups
  -   Read non-hidden Group memberships
  -   Add guests to Owned groups
  -   Create new application
  -   Add up to 50 devices to Azure
- Tokens
  - OAuth 2.0 and OIDC use bearer tokens which are JSON Web Tokens. 
  - A bearer token, as the name suggests, grants the bearer access to a protected resource.
  - There are three types of tokens used in OIDC:
    - Access Tokens - The client presents this token to the resource server to access resources. It can be used only for a specific combination of user, client, and resource and cannot be revoked until expiry - that is 1 hour by default. 
    - ID Tokens - The client receives this token from the authorization server. It contains basic information about the user. It is bound to a specific combination of user and client.
    - Refresh Tokens - Provided to the client with access token. Used to get new access and ID tokens. It is bound to a specific combination of user and client and can be revoked. Default expiry is 90 days for inactive refresh tokens and no expiry for active tokens.
